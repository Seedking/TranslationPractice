Anne's Best Friend
------------------
Do you want a frtiend whom you could tell every thing to, like your deepest feelings and thoughts? Or are you afraid that your friend would laugh at you, or would not understand what you are going through? Anne Frank wanted the first kind, so she made her diary her best friend.  
　　Anne lived in Amsterdam in the Netherlands during World War II. her family was Jewish so they had to hide or they would be caught by the German Nazis. She and her family hid away for nearly twenty-five months before they were discovered. During that time the only true friend was her diary . She said,"I don't want to set down a series of facts in a diary as most people do, but I want this diary itself to be my friend, and I shall call my friend Kitty" Now read how she felt after being in the hiding place since.

Dear Kitty  

I wonder if it's because I haven't been able to be outdoors for so long that I've grown so crazy about everything to do with nature. I can well remember that there was a time when a deep blue sky<!---->, the song of the birds,moonlight and flowers could never have kept me spellbound. That's changed since I came here.  
... For example, one evening when it was so warm, I stayed awake on purpose until half past eleven in order to have a good look at the moon by myself. But as the moon gave far too much light, I didn't dare open a window. Another time five months ago, I happened to be upstairs at dusk when the windows was open. I didn't go down stairs until the window had to be shut. the dark, rainy evening, the wind, the thundering clouds held me entirely in their power; it was the first time in a year and a half that I'd seen the night face to face...  
...Sadly ... I am only able to look at nature through dirty curtains hanging before very dusty windows. It's no pleasure looking through these any longer because nature is one thing that really must be experienced.

no blabla any longer
就是blabla，but not any longer

Yours,  
Anne  


安妮最好的朋友
-------------
你想不想要一个可以倾诉任何事情的朋友吗，比如你深邃的感觉和想法？或者你害怕你的朋友会笑话你，或者不理解你的经历？安妮弗兰克想要第一种，所以她写了她的日记她最好的朋友。  
安妮在第二次世界大战期间生活在荷兰的阿姆斯特丹。她的家庭是犹太人所以他们需要隐蔽自己如果不这么做就会德国纳粹抓走。她和她的家人在被发现之前藏起来了25个月左右。在这段时间里她唯一的朋友是她的日记。她说“我不想像其他人一样在我的日记里记录下一系列事情，但是我想让这日记本身成为我的朋友，然后我要叫它为Kitty”现在看看她自从那以后在藏身处都经历了什么。

亲爱的Kitty  

我想是不是因为我太久没能出门，我对自然的一切都感到十分感兴趣。我清晰地记得曾经那深蓝色的天空，鸟的歌声，月光和花朵永远不能让我着迷。自从我来到了这里就改变了。  
...比如，一个炎热的晚上，为了自己能更好的看月亮我故意保持清醒直到十一点半。但是当月亮发出太亮的光，我没敢打开窗户。五月前的另一次，我黄昏恰好在楼上那时窗户是打开的。直到窗户不得不关上我才下楼。黑暗，雨夜，大风，雷云完全控制着我；这是一年半以来的第一次面对面看着这夜晚...
...伤心...我只能透过沾满灰尘的窗户前挂着的肮脏窗帘观察自然。看穿这些东西没有任何乐趣了,因为必须体验自然。

Dear Miss Wang,  
　　I am having some trouble with my classmates at the moment. I'm getting along well with a boy in my class. We often do homework together and we enjoy helping each other. We have become really good friends. But other students have started gossiping. They say that this boy and I have fallen in love. This has made me angry. I don't want to end the friendship, but I hate others gossiping. What should I do?  

Dear Miss Wang,  
I'm a student from Huzhou Senior High School. I have a problem. I'm not very good at communicating with people. Although I try to talk to my classmates, I still find it hard to make good friends with them. So i feel quite lonely sometimes. I do want to change this situation, but i don't know how. I would be grateful if you could give me some advice.

亲爱的王小姐，  
我现在有一些关于同班同学的烦恼。我和一个班里的男孩子相处的很好。我们经常一起做作业经常互相帮助彼此。我们成为了真正的好朋友。但是其他的同学开始流言蜚语。他们说这个男孩和我在谈恋爱。这让我感觉非常生气。我不想结束我们的友谊，但是我讨厌他们的流言蜚语。我应该怎么做？

亲爱的王小姐，  
我是湖州高中的一名学生。我有一个问题。我和人们沟通的不是非常好。尽管我尝试和我的同班同学讲话，我还是感觉很难和他们成为好朋友。所以我有时候相当的孤独。我想改变这个状况，但是我该怎么办。如果你能给我一些建议我会非常感激。
