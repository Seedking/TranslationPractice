The Road To Modern English
--------------------------

At the end of the 16th century, about five to seven million people spoke English. Nearly all of them lived in England. Later in the next century, people from England made voyages to other parts of the world and because of that, English began to be spoken in many other countries. Today, more people speak English as their first, second or a foreign language than ever before.  
Native English speakers can understand each other even if they don't speak the same kind of English. Look at this example:  

British Betty: Would you like to see my flat?  
American Amy: Yes, I'd like to come up to your apartment.  

So why has English changed over time? Actually all languages change and develop when cultures meet and communicate with each other. At first the English spoken in England between about AD 450 and 1150 was very different from the English spoken today. It was based more on German than the English we speak at present.Then gradually between about AD 800 and 1150, English became less like German because those who ruled England spoke first Danish and later French. These new settlers enriched the English language and especially its vocabulary. So by the 1600's Shakespeare was able to make use of a wider vocabulary than ever before. In 1620 some British settlers moved to America. Later in the 18th century some British people were taken to Australia too. English began to be spoken in both countries.  
Finally by the 18th century the language was settled. At that time two big changes in English spelling happened: first Samuel Johnson wrote his dictionary and later Noah Webster wrote The American Dictionary of the English Language. The latter gave a separate identity to American English spelling.  
English now is also spoken as a foreign or second language in South Asia. For example, India has a very large number of fluent English speakers because Britain ruled India from 1765 to 1947. During that time English became the language for government and education. English is also spoken in Singapore and Malaysia and countries in Africa such as South Africa. Today the number of people learning English in China is increasing rapidly. In fact, China may have the largest number of English learners. Will Chinese English develop its own identity? Only time will tell.  

现代英语之路
-----------
16世纪末，大约有五百万到七百万人在说英语。他们接近全部都生活在英格兰。下一个世纪晚一些的时候，人们从英格兰航行到世界的其他地方，正因为如此很多其他国家也开始讲英语。现在，比以往任何时候都更多的人们以英语为他们的第一、第二，或者外语。  
以英语为母语的人能彼此理解即使如果他们不说相同种类的英语。看看这个例子：  
英国的Betty：你想看我的公寓吗？  
美国的Amy：是的，我想去你的公寓。  
所以为什么英语随着时间过去而改变？事实上所有语言的改变和发展来自文化彼此的相遇和交流。最早的英语在大约公元450到1150年的英格兰，和现在的英语非常不一样。它更多的基于德语而不是我们现在说的英语。然后在大约公约800到1150年之间英语逐渐开始变得更不像德语因为那些统治英格兰的人先说丹麦语于后来说法语。这些新的殖民者丰富了英语尤其是它的词汇量。所以在公元1600年的时候莎士比亚的词汇量比以往更大量。在公元1620年一些英国殖民者们前往美洲。18世纪末，一些英国人也被带到澳大利亚。这两个国家都开始说英语了。  
最终到了18世纪，这种语言确定了。这时英语拼写有两个大改变：首先Samuel Johnson写了他的词典，后来Noah Webster写了《美国英语词典》。后者给美国英语的拼写方式提供了一个独立的身份。  
英语现在也作为南亚的外交或第二语言。举个例子，印度有非常多的流利的英语使用者因为英国曾经统治印度从1765年到1947年。在这段期间里英语成为了政府和学校的语言。英语也是新加坡和马来西亚还有非洲如南非等国家的语言。今天在中国学习英语的人的数量在快速的增长。事实上，中国也许有最多的英语学习者。中国的英语发展出它自己的身份吗？时间会给出答案。
