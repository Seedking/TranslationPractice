Thursday 15th June,1944 Dear Kitty I wonder if it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t been able to be outdoors for so long that I\u2019ve grown so crazy about everything to do with nature. I can well remember that there was a time when a deep blue sky , the song of the birds,moonlight and flowers could never have kept me spellbound. That\u2019s changed since I came here. \u2026 For example, one evening when it was so warm, I stayed awake on purpose until half past eleven in order to have a good look at the moon by myself. But as the moon gave far too much light, I didn\u2019t dare open a window. Another time five months ago, I happened to be upstairs at dusk when the windows was open. I didn\u2019t go down stairs until the window had to be shut. the dark, rainy evening, the wind, the thundering clouds held me entirely in their power; it was the first time in a year and a half that I\u2019d seen the night face to face\u2026 \u2026Sadly \u2026 I am only able to look at nature through dirty curtains hanging before very dusty windows.

I\u2019m getting along well with a boy in my class. We often do homework together and we enjoy helping each other. We have become really good friends. But other students have started gossiping. They say that this boy and I have fallen in love. This has made me angry. I don\u2019t want to end the friendship, but I hate others gossiping. What should I do? Dear Miss Wang, I\u2019m a student from Huzhou Senior High School. I have a problem. I\u2019m not very good at communicating with people. Although I try to talk to my classmates, I still find it hard to make good friends with them. So i feel quite lonely sometimes. I do want to change this situation, but i don\u2019t know how. I would be grateful if you could give me some advice. \u8bfb \u4eb2\u7231\u7684\u738b\u5c0f\u59d0\uff0c \u6211\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u540c\u73ed\u540c\u5b66\u7684\u70e6\u607c\u3002\u6211\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u73ed\u91cc\u7684\u7537\u5b69\u5b50\u76f8\u5904\u7684\u5f88\u597d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e00\u8d77\u505a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e92\u76f8\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f7c\u6b64\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u597d\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u5b66\u5f00\u59cb\u6d41\u8a00\u871a\u8bed\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7537\u5b69\u548c\u6211\u5728\u8c08\u604b\u7231\u3002\u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u611f\u89c9\u975e\u5e38\u751f\u6c14\u3002\u6211\u4e0d\u60f3\u7ed3\u675f\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u53cb\u8c0a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u8ba8\u538c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6d41\u8a00\u871a\u8bed\u3002\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u505a\uff1f \u4eb2\u7231\u7684\u738b\u5c0f\u59d0\uff0c \u6211\u662f\u6e56\u5dde\u9ad8\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u6211\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6211\u548c\u4eba\u4eec\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6211\u5c1d\u8bd5\u548c\u6211\u7684\u540c\u73ed\u540c\u5b66\u8bb2\u8bdd\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u611f\u89c9\u5f88\u96be\u548c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u597d\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5b64\u72ec\u3002\u6211\u60f3\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u4e2a\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u529e\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u80fd\u7ed9\u6211\u4e00\u4e9b\u5efa\u8bae\u6211\u4f1a\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u6fc0\u3002 \u751f\u8bcd\u8868 become v.\u6210\u4e3a say that \u636e\u8bf4\u2026 hate v.\u8ba8\u538c problem n.\u95ee\u9898 \u611f\u89c9\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u68d8\u624b\u7684\u95ee\u9898 communicating v.\u6c9f\u901a Although conj.\u5c3d\u7ba1 still adv.\u8fd8 quite adv.\u76f8\u5f53\u7684 situation n.\u60c5\u51b5 grateful adj.\u611f\u6fc0 advice n.\u5efa\u8bae","title":"\u5fc5\u4fee\u4e00\u7b2c\u4e00\u5355\u5143"},{"location":"high%20school%20english%20textbook/compulsory%201%20unit%201/#annes-best-friend","text":"Do you want a frtiend whom you could tell every thing to, like your deepest feelings and thoughts?

I didn\u2019t go down stairs until the window had to be shut. the dark, rainy evening, the wind, the thundering clouds held me entirely in their power; it was the first time in a year and a half that I\u2019d seen the night face to face\u2026 \u2026Sadly \u2026 I am only able to look at nature through dirty curtains hanging before very dusty windows. It\u2019s no pleasure looking through these any longer because nature is one thing that really must be experienced.

Nearly all of them lived in England. Later in the next century, people from England made voyages to other parts of the world and because of that, English began to be spoken in many other countries. Today, more people speak English as their first, second or a foreign language than ever before. Native English speakers can understand each other even if they don\u2019t speak the same kind of English. Look at this example: British Betty: Would you like to see my flat? American Amy: Yes, I\u2019d like to come up to your apartment. So why has English changed over time? Actually all languages change and develop when cultures meet and communicate with each other. At first the English spoken in England between about AD 450 and 1150 was very different from the English spoken today. It was based more on German than the English we speak at present.Then gradually between about AD 800 and 1150, English became less like German because those who ruled England spoke first Danish and later French. These new settlers enriched the English language and especially its vocabulary. So by the 1600\u2019s Shakespeare was able to make use of a wider vocabulary than ever before. In 1620 some British settlers moved to America. Later in the 18th century some British people were taken to Australia too. English began to be spoken in both countries. Finally by the 18th century the language was settled. At that time two big changes in English spelling happened: first Samuel Johnson wrote his dictionary and later Noah Webster wrote The American Dictionary of the English Language. The latter gave a separate identity to American English spelling. English now is also spoken as a foreign or second language in South Asia. For example, India has a very large number of fluent English speakers because Britain ruled India from 1765 to 1947. During that time English became the language for government and education. English is also spoken in Singapore and Malaysia and countries in Africa such as South Africa. Today the number of people learning English in China is increasing rapidly. In fact, China may have the largest number of English learners. Will Chinese English develop its own identity? Only time will tell. \u73b0\u4ee3\u82f1\u8bed\u4e4b\u8def

Nearly all of them lived in England. Later in the next century, people from England made voyages to other parts of the world and because of that, English began to be spoken in many other countries. Today, more people speak English as their first, second or a foreign language than ever before. Native English speakers can understand each other even if they don\u2019t speak the same kind of English. Look at this example: British Betty: Would you like to see my flat? American Amy: Yes, I\u2019d like to come up to your apartment. So why has English changed over time? Actually all languages change and develop when cultures meet and communicate with each other. At first the English spoken in England between about AD 450 and 1150 was very different from the English spoken today. It was based more on German than the English we speak at present.Then gradually between about AD 800 and 1150, English became less like German because those who ruled England spoke first Danish and later French. These new settlers enriched the English language and especially its vocabulary. So by the 1600\u2019s Shakespeare was able to make use of a wider vocabulary than ever before. In 1620 some British settlers moved to America. Later in the 18th century some British people were taken to Australia too. English began to be spoken in both countries. Finally by the 18th century the language was settled. At that time two big changes in English spelling happened: first Samuel Johnson wrote his dictionary and later Noah Webster wrote The American Dictionary of the English Language. The latter gave a separate identity to American English spelling. English now is also spoken as a foreign or second language in South Asia. For example, India has a very large number of fluent English speakers because Britain ruled India from 1765 to 1947. During that time English became the language for government and education. English is also spoken in Singapore and Malaysia and countries in Africa such as South Africa. Today the number of people learning English in China is increasing rapidly. In fact, China may have the largest number of English learners. Will Chinese English develop its own identity? Only time will tell.","title":"The Road To Modern
